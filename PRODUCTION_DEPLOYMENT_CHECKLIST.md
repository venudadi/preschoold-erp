# Production Deployment Checklist - Preschool ERP System

## 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED ✅

### Security Vulnerabilities Fixed:
- ✅ **CSRF and Session Validation Enabled** - Previously disabled validation has been restored
- ✅ **Production CORS Configuration** - Restricted to specific origins with proper security headers
- ✅ **Security Headers Added** - X-Frame-Options, XSS-Protection, HSTS, Content-Type-Options
- ✅ **Console.log Statements Cleaned** - Debug statements removed from production code
- ✅ **Production Environment Template Created** - Comprehensive .env.production.template

## 📋 PRE-DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Environment Configuration (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Copy and configure the production environment file
cp backend/.env.production.template backend/.env
```

**Required Changes in .env:**
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Replace `DB_PASSWORD` with secure database credentials
- [ ] Generate new `JWT_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] Generate new `CSRF_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] Set `FRONTEND_URL` to your actual domain
- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with your production domains
- [ ] Set up email configuration (SMTP_*)
- [ ] Configure AWS S3 settings (if using cloud storage)

### 2. Database Setup
- [ ] Run production database migrations
- [ ] Set up database backup strategy
- [ ] Configure database connection pooling (minimum 20 connections for production)
- [ ] Ensure proper database indexing is in place

### 3. SSL/TLS Configuration
- [ ] Obtain SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache)
- [ ] Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` in production
- [ ] Enable HTTPS redirects

### 4. Process Management
- [ ] Install PM2 or equivalent process manager
- [ ] Configure auto-restart on failure
- [ ] Set up log rotation
- [ ] Configure cluster mode for scalability

### 5. Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up application monitoring (e.g., New Relic, DataDog)
- [ ] Configure error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Set up log aggregation
- [ ] Configure health check endpoints
- [ ] Set up database monitoring

## 🔧 DEPLOYMENT SCRIPTS

### Backend Deployment
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci --production

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate

# Build if necessary (already using ES modules)
# No build step required for this backend

# Start with PM2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

### Frontend Deployment
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Build for production
npm run build

# Serve static files (example with Nginx)
# Copy dist/ folder to web server root
```

### Example PM2 Ecosystem Config (backend/ecosystem.config.js)
```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: 'preschool-erp-api',
    script: './index.js',
    instances: 'max',
    exec_mode: 'cluster',
    env_production: {
      NODE_ENV: 'production',
      PORT: 5001
    },
    log_file: '/var/log/preschool-erp/combined.log',
    out_file: '/var/log/preschool-erp/out.log',
    error_file: '/var/log/preschool-erp/error.log',
    log_date_format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm Z',
    merge_logs: true,
    max_restarts: 5,
    min_uptime: '10s'
  }]
};
```

## 🛡️ SECURITY HARDENING

### Server Security
- [ ] Configure firewall (UFW/iptables)
- [ ] Disable unnecessary services
- [ ] Set up fail2ban for intrusion prevention
- [ ] Regular security updates scheduled
- [ ] SSH key authentication only
- [ ] Change default SSH port

### Application Security
- [ ] Enable rate limiting in production
- [ ] Configure session timeout appropriately
- [ ] Set up CSRF token validation (already implemented)
- [ ] Enable request logging for audit trail
- [ ] Configure secure cookie settings

## 📊 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### Backend Optimizations
- [ ] Configure Redis for session storage and caching
- [ ] Implement database query caching
- [ ] Set up CDN for static assets
- [ ] Configure gzip compression
- [ ] Optimize database connection pooling

### Frontend Optimizations
- [ ] Enable service worker for offline support
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for large components
- [ ] Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- [ ] Configure proper caching headers
- [ ] Minify and compress static assets

## 📈 MONITORING SETUP

### Health Checks
```bash
# Add to backend/routes/health.js
GET /api/health
GET /api/health/db
GET /api/health/redis
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- [ ] Response times
- [ ] Error rates
- [ ] Database connection pool usage
- [ ] Memory and CPU usage
- [ ] Active user sessions
- [ ] File upload rates

## 🗄️ BACKUP STRATEGY

### Database Backups
```bash
# Daily automated backup script
#!/bin/bash
mysqldump -u $DB_USER -p$DB_PASSWORD $DB_NAME > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
# Upload to S3 or secure storage
```

### File Backups
- [ ] Set up automated S3 sync for uploaded files
- [ ] Implement backup retention policy
- [ ] Test backup restoration procedures

## 🚀 GO-LIVE PROCESS

### Pre-Launch Testing
- [ ] Load testing with expected user volume
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] End-to-end functionality testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

### Launch Day
1. [ ] Database migration to production
2. [ ] Deploy backend with PM2
3. [ ] Deploy frontend to web server
4. [ ] Configure DNS and SSL
5. [ ] Test all critical user flows
6. [ ] Monitor error logs and performance
7. [ ] Have rollback plan ready

### Post-Launch Monitoring (First 24 Hours)
- [ ] Monitor error rates every 15 minutes
- [ ] Check database performance
- [ ] Monitor user registration and login flows
- [ ] Verify email notifications working
- [ ] Check file upload functionality
- [ ] Monitor WebSocket connections

## 🆘 INCIDENT RESPONSE

### Escalation Plan
1. **Level 1**: Application errors, slow response times
2. **Level 2**: Database issues, authentication failures
3. **Level 3**: Security breaches, data corruption

### Emergency Contacts
- [ ] Set up alert notifications (email, SMS, Slack)
- [ ] Define response time SLAs
- [ ] Prepare rollback procedures

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

### Technical KPIs
- Response time < 200ms for API calls
- Uptime > 99.9%
- Database query time < 100ms
- Zero security incidents

### Business KPIs
- User registration completion rate
- Daily active users
- Feature adoption rates
- Support ticket volume

## 🔗 USEFUL PRODUCTION COMMANDS

```bash
# Check application status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs preschool-erp-api

# Restart application
pm2 restart preschool-erp-api

# Database backup
mysqldump -u user -p database_name > backup.sql

# Check disk space
df -h

# Monitor system resources
htop

# Check SSL certificate expiry
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout | grep "Not After"
```

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

After deployment, verify these endpoints:
- [ ] `GET /api/health` - Returns 200 OK
- [ ] `POST /api/auth/login` - Authentication works
- [ ] `GET /api/auth/verify` - Token validation works
- [ ] Frontend loads without console errors
- [ ] WebSocket connections establish successfully
- [ ] File uploads work properly
- [ ] Email notifications send correctly
