# Migration Fix Summary - October 12, 2025

## Current Status

**Migration Progress:** 028 out of 38 migrations (74% complete)

**Current Error:**
Failed at migration 028_add_student_pause_functionality.sql
Error: Referencing column 'student_id' and referenced column 'id' in foreign key constraint are incompatible.

## Root Cause

The children.id column in production database has type INT (from old deployments), but new schema expects VARCHAR(36). This causes FK constraint failures when creating tables with foreign keys to children.

## Already Fixed (Committed)

1. Migration 023: Changed FK reference from students (VIEW) to children (TABLE)
2. Migration 024: Separated ADD COLUMN from ADD CONSTRAINT
3. Migration 028: Removed inline FK constraints from CREATE TABLE
4. migrate.js: Added errno 3780 handler for ADD CONSTRAINT failures

## Current Issue

Despite fixes, migration 028 still fails with inline FK error, suggesting DigitalOcean deployed a cached version.

## Next Action Required

Add robust error handler to migrate.js to strip inline FKs from CREATE TABLE and retry.
