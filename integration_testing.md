# Integration Testing Plan - Multi-Center Preschool ERP System

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive integration testing strategy for the preschool ERP system to verify complete functionality across all user roles, pages, and workflows.

## System Architecture Summary
- **Frontend:** React with Vite, Material-UI components
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express with MySQL
- **Authentication:** JWT-based with role-based access control
- **User Roles:** 8 distinct roles (Super Admin, Owner, Financial Manager, Center Director, Admin, Academic Coordinator, Teacher, Parent)
- **Features:** 50+ distinct features with granular permissions
- **Pages:** 20+ functional pages with role-specific access

---

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Authentication & Authorization Testing
**Objective:** Verify login functionality and role-based access enforcement

#### Test Scenarios:
1. **Login Flow Testing**
   - Valid credentials for each role
   - Invalid credentials handling
   - Auto-login functionality
   - Session management
   - Logout functionality

2. **Role Assignment Verification**
   - Correct role assignment after login
   - Role-specific dashboard loading
   - Permission validation

3. **Security Boundary Testing**
   - Access attempt to unauthorized routes
   - JWT token validation
   - Session timeout handling

#### AI Testing Prompt:
```
You are testing authentication and authorization for a preschool ERP system.

CONTEXT: You have access to login credentials for 8 different user roles. The system uses JWT authentication with role-based access control.

TASK: Systematically test the authentication flow for each role:
1. Test login with role: [ROLE_NAME]
2. Verify correct dashboard loads for the role
3. Confirm navigation menu shows only authorized items
4. Test access to unauthorized routes (should be blocked)
5. Verify logout functionality
6. Document any authentication failures or security issues

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Successful login redirects to appropriate dashboard
- Navigation reflects role permissions from permissions.js
- Unauthorized access attempts are blocked
- Clean logout clears session

LOG: Record login success/failure, dashboard type loaded, navigation items visible, and any security violations.
```

### Phase 2: Role-Based Navigation & Access Control Testing
**Objective:** Verify that each role sees only authorized navigation items and pages

#### Test Scenarios:

   - Navigation routing functionality

2. **Page Access Control**
   - Direct URL access attempts
   - Breadcrumb navigation
   - Back/forward browser navigation

3. **Feature-Level Access Control**
   - Component visibility within pages
   - Action button availability
   - Data filtering by role

#### AI Testing Prompt:
```
You are testing role-based navigation and access control for a preschool ERP system.

CONTEXT: The system has 8 user roles with different permission levels defined in permissions.js. Each role should see different navigation items and have access to different features.

TASK: For role [ROLE_NAME], systematically verify:
1. Login as [ROLE_NAME]
2. Compare visible navigation items against expected permissions in permissions.js
3. Test each accessible navigation link
4. Attempt to access restricted URLs directly (e.g., /users for non-super-admin)
5. Verify page content matches role permissions
6. Test all interactive elements (buttons, forms, etc.) are appropriate for role

ROLE PERMISSIONS TO VERIFY:
[INSERT SPECIFIC ROLE PERMISSIONS FROM permissions.js]

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Navigation menu matches getFilteredNavigation() result for role
- All links lead to accessible pages
- Restricted pages show access denied or redirect
- Page content respects role limitations

LOG: Record navigation items shown, successful page loads, access denials, and any permission bypasses.

## Dynamic Logging System

### Logging Structure
Create a JSON-based logging system that captures:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "testPhase": "Phase 1 - Authentication",
  "currentStep": "Login as Super Admin",
  "userRole": "super_admin",
  "action": "login_attempt",
  "result": "success|failure",
  "details": {
    "url": "/login",
    "credentials": "admin@test.com",
    "responseTime": "250ms",
    "dashboardLoaded": "SuperAdminDashboard"
  },
  "errors": [],
  "nextStep": "Verify navigation menu items",
  "contextData": {
    "currentUser": "admin@test.com",
    "activeRole": "super_admin",
    "sessionToken": "jwt_token_hash"
  }
}
```

### Recovery Context File
```json

  "currentPhase": 1,
  "currentRole": "super_admin",
  "completedSteps": ["login", "dashboard_load"],
  "pendingSteps": ["navigation_test", "access_control_test"],
  "testData": {
    "createdRecords": ["user_123", "student_456"],
    "modifiedRecords": ["classroom_789"]
  },
  "environmentState": {
    "serverRunning": true,
    "databaseConnected": true,
    "testDataLoaded": true
  }
}
```

### Logging Implementation Prompt
```
You are implementing a dynamic logging system for integration testing.

TASK: Create comprehensive logs for each testing action:
1. Log before starting each test step
2. Log results immediately after completion
3. Update context file with current state
4. Include error details and recovery information
5. Timestamp all activities

LOG EVERYTHING:
- User actions (clicks, form submissions, navigation)
- System responses (page loads, data updates, errors)
- Performance metrics (load times, response times)
- Data state changes (creates, updates, deletes)
- Authentication state changes

RECOVERY INFORMATION:
- Current test position
- Active user session details
- Created/modified test data
- Environment prerequisites
- Next steps to execute

Use this format for all testing activities to ensure complete traceability and recovery capability.
