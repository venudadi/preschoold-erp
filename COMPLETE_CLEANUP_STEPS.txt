GIT HISTORY CLEANUP - COMPLETION STEPS
================================================================================

STATUS: Git history has been successfully cleaned! ✓

The backend/.env file with the Anthropic API key has been completely removed
from your git history. Now you just need to push the cleaned history to GitHub.

================================================================================
WHAT WAS DONE
================================================================================

✓ Installed git-filter-repo
✓ Created backup branch: backup-before-cleanup
✓ Removed backend/.env from ALL commits in history
✓ Re-added remote origin
✓ Verified backend/.env is completely gone from history

================================================================================
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW
================================================================================

STEP 1: AUTHENTICATE WITH GITHUB
---------------------------------

The push failed because git is trying to use account "dadiprak4599" but the
repository belongs to "venudadi".

Choose ONE of these options:

OPTION A - Use Personal Access Token (Recommended):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Name: "Preschool ERP Deployment"
   - Expiration: 90 days (or choose)
   - Scopes: Check ✓ "repo" (full control of private repositories)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - COPY THE TOKEN (you won't see it again!)

2. Push using the token:

   git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/venudadi/preschoold-erp.git main --force

   Replace YOUR_TOKEN with the token you copied.

3. When successful, update the remote URL to use the token:

   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/venudadi/preschoold-erp.git


OPTION B - Use SSH (Alternative):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Check if you have SSH key:

   ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

   If not found, generate one:

   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "venuvikasdadi@gmail.com"
   (Press Enter for all prompts)

2. Copy your SSH public key:

   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

3. Add to GitHub:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Title: "Windows PC"
   - Key: Paste the key from step 2
   - Click "Add SSH key"

4. Change remote to use SSH:

   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:venudadi/preschoold-erp.git

5. Push:

   git push origin main --force


OPTION C - Update Git Credentials (Simplest):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Clear stored credentials:

   git credential-manager delete https://github.com

   OR on Windows:
   - Open "Credential Manager" from Start menu
   - Click "Windows Credentials"
   - Find "git:https://github.com"
   - Click "Remove"

2. Try pushing again (will prompt for credentials):

   git push origin main --force

3. When prompted:
   - Username: venudadi
   - Password: Use a Personal Access Token (create from Option A above)


STEP 2: FORCE PUSH THE CLEANED HISTORY
---------------------------------------

After authentication is set up, run:

   git push origin main --force

Expected output:
   + 761648f...23fb158 main -> main (forced update)

This updates GitHub with the cleaned history (no more backend/.env secret).


STEP 3: CREATE AND PUSH STAGING BRANCH
---------------------------------------

1. Create staging branch:

   git checkout -b staging

2. Push staging branch:

   git push origin staging --force

Expected output:
   * [new branch]      staging -> staging


STEP 4: VERIFY ON GITHUB
-------------------------

1. Go to: https://github.com/venudadi/preschoold-erp

2. Check branches:
   - You should see "main" and "staging" branches ✓

3. Try pushing to staging again (should work now):

   echo "test" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "test: verify push works"
   git push origin staging

4. If successful, the secret issue is RESOLVED! ✓


STEP 5: PROCEED WITH STAGING DEPLOYMENT
----------------------------------------

Once the push works, you can proceed with DigitalOcean deployment:

1. Open: STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.txt

2. Go to STEP 3: "CREATE DIGITALOCEAN ACCOUNT"

3. Follow the rest of the deployment guide

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

ERROR: "fatal: The requested URL returned error: 403"
SOLUTION: Authentication issue - use Option A, B, or C above

ERROR: "remote: Permission denied"
SOLUTION: Wrong credentials - verify you're using the correct GitHub account

ERROR: "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work"
SOLUTION: This is expected - use --force flag (history was rewritten)

ERROR: "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"
SOLUTION: Use --force when pushing (history was rewritten)

================================================================================
BACKUP INFORMATION
================================================================================

Your original history is saved in branch: backup-before-cleanup

To view original commits:
   git log backup-before-cleanup

To restore if needed (NOT RECOMMENDED):
   git reset --hard backup-before-cleanup
   git push origin main --force

To delete backup after successful deployment:
   git branch -D backup-before-cleanup

================================================================================
CURRENT STATUS
================================================================================

✓ Git history cleaned (backend/.env removed from all commits)
✓ Backup created: backup-before-cleanup
✓ Ready to push to GitHub
⚠ Authentication needed - choose Option A, B, or C above
☐ Force push to main
☐ Create and push staging branch
☐ Deploy to DigitalOcean

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED NEXT COMMAND
================================================================================

After setting up authentication (Option A recommended):

   git push origin main --force

Then:

   git checkout -b staging
   git push origin staging --force

Then proceed to: STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.txt (Step 3)

================================================================================
QUESTIONS?
================================================================================

If you get stuck, you can also use the quick fix from Step 1 Option A:
   https://github.com/venudadi/preschoold-erp/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/33q7ZO2ikii6RoExgAjheGyw5YX

This allows you to push without cleaning history (acceptable for staging/testing).
